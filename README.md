Start

In General:
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

jupyter notebook
This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). If you store the notebook documents in a subfolder of your user folder no configuration is necessary. Otherwise, you need to choose a folder which will contain all the notebooks and set this as the Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder.

Moneyball.ipynb can be open in a web browser for viewing.



Description
In the movie / book Moneyball - data analysis is employed to discover that teams that had a roster containing players with a high on base percentage (OBP) did very well in the regular season. Using this knowledge the General Manager was able to create a very successful team on a shoestring budget with players that had a high OBP.

Moneyball works with public data from The Lahman Baseball Database, creates a summary table that in turn gives a great hitting team (by year) with a very small salary.

Moneyball.ipynb joins together many of the different tables so you are able to find each player's OBP and their salary.  Finally moneyball pulls a starting 9 player roster for a single season.
